# Intraday Trading Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an intraday trading algorithm developed by Kunal, a full-stack developer based in Mumbai, India. Kunal, who is also a proactive stock market trader, has crafted an algorithmic approach to capitalize on intraday opportunities in the BankNifty index options.

## Flowchart

The algorithm follows a systematic flow outlined in a comprehensive flowchart. It begins by assessing market conditions, checking the time, and ensuring the market is open on weekdays. Subsequently, it executes a dynamic intraday strategy based on the current BankNifty Last Traded Price (LTP).

## Key Steps

1. **Market Assessment:** Checks if it's a weekday and if the market is open during trading hours.

2. **Trade Execution:** Implements the intraday strategy, involving selling At-The-Money (ATM) options for BankNifty.

3. **Dynamic Strategy:** Monitors option prices, initiates trades, closes profitable options, and adapts based on market movements.

4. **Risk Management:** Includes mechanisms to assess Mark-to-Market (MTM) values and apply stop-loss criteria.

## Usage

To use this algorithm, follow the outlined steps in the flowchart. Ensure the necessary dependencies and configurations are in place before running the algorithm.

## Disclaimer

Trading involves risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Kunal encourages users to thoroughly understand the algorithm, backtest it, and use it responsibly.
